This is a responsive [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that queries the [The Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and allows users to make a list (maximum of 5) of movies they would like to nominate for the Shoppies awards. Both designs and development by remiBoudreau (me).

The app uses the following stack:

- Material UI
- Nextjs
- Redux
